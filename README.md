# Mobile Application Development: Cooperative Learning

## Description/Overview
This repository is part of my assessment in the Mobile App Development course. The goal is to engage in Android Shared Learning, where we not only learn Android Studio through lectures but also guide our classmates with techniques that we have not covered internally. This approach aims to enhance our projects, skills, and proficiency in using Android Studio.
